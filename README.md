## 📁 Repository Structure

| File Name              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `factorialcal.c`       | Program to calculate the factorial of a number.                             |
| `fibonacci.c`          | Program to generate Fibonacci series.                                       |
| `hello.c`              | 🧪 *Test file* used to prototype and debug logic before applying it elsewhere. |
| `non_duplicate_digits.c` | Prints numbers without repeating digits (e.g., 123, 120).                  |
| `primenumber.c`        | Checks if a number is prime or not.                                         |
| `reversenumber.c`      | Reverses a given integer.                                                   |

## 📌 Notes

- The file `hello.c` serves as a scratchpad to test logic before implementing it in the main code.
- `a.exe` is a compiled output file and not meant to be version-controlled (consider ignoring this using `.gitignore`).

## 🚀 How to Run

To compile and run any file:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
./fibonacci

Let me know if you'd like to:
- Add your name/contact as author
- Add `.gitignore` to hide `a.exe`
- Turn this into a portfolio-worthy repo with badges, contributors, etc.

Would you like me to generate that `.gitignore` file too?
