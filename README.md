| Program File              | Description                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `hello.c`                | Basic hello world output                    |
| `factorialcal.c`         | Calculates factorial using loops/recursion  |
| `fibonacci.c`            | Generates Fibonacci series up to `n` terms |
| `primenumber.c`          | Checks if a number is prime                 |
| `reversenumber.c`        | Reverses a given number                     |
| `non_duplicate_digits.c` | Checks if a number contains only unique digits |
| `oddoreven.c`            | Checks the input number is even or odd      |

## 🚀 How to Run

### Compile:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
```

Run:
```bash
./filename.exe
```
Replace filename with your program name (e.g., hello).
